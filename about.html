        Hello, my name is Gerardo Montemayor. I grew up
        in Clarksville, Maryland and am currently a sophomore
        at Cornell University studying computer science. I've always
        enjoyed solving problems and I enjoy applying those skills to
        software programming.

      My Journey Into CS
    </div>
    <div class="aboutme more-about-text">
      I first started learning about computer science in early 
      quarantine. I took an introductory course in Cybersecurity
      at the Johns Hopkins STEM Academy. In highschool, I took a 
      few other CS courses and learned Java.
    </div>
    <div class="aboutme more-about-text">
      Coming into college, I still wasn't sure what I wanted to study,
      but after taking my first class in Python, I was immediately drawn to the study.
      I realized that I enjoyed writing programs and seeing them work right in 
      front of me. So I decided to continue in this direction, learning python and 
      diving more into Java my freshman year. 
    </div>
    <div class="aboutme more-about-text">
      Now, I'm excited to be taking even more advanced courses in computer science, 
      having recently taken a functional programming course and soon to be taking Machine Learning
      and Algorithms. This past semester I worked on a several-month long project with a team where
      we programmed a Cornell-inspired Tower Defense Game. Check it out in my projects section!
